populations. By Recognizing people's ability to afford services, our prices will be based off the market's need. 
Equal opportunity, which will impact employees and customers.

**Honest communication, Data Protection, Safety, Innovation **
  - Honest Communication: Should entail the chain of command, to application users and the public. While safety is important, 
  communication can go a long way. The public should be aware of our practice and the ways that our users can impact society. 
  We believe that environmental health is critical in the coming years or decades. We strive to deliver interpersonal communication
  skills.
  - Data Protection: Risk elimination falls in this category. Lots of data will build upon another. Historical data will be 
  useful to implement and improve our application. Application users, clients, customers, fellow colleagues and the general
  public will develop trust in each other. Certain data will receive special considerations, such as knowing the confidential
  nature of certain types of data. Encryption will be used to defend data transmission. Security software will assist to prevent
  hackers from obtaining personal and confidential information.

  -Innovation: We listen to our customers, coworkers, leaders, and the public. Even though we may succeed, there comes a cost to
   innovate. Our software shall improve through ethical standards. These standards will focus on data and public safety. It is
   critical to put others first, while we innovate to bring about technological changes.

Ideal Board Members

Sundar Pichai, CEO (Google) -> Focuses on accuracy and efficiency on information obtainment and delivery. This idea 
contributes to the society data privacy and safety. Google maps collect large amounts of the world's data and uses it in ethical ways 
in concurrent to their search engine.

Yoshihiro Hidaka, VP of Yamaha, USA (Yamaha) -> Yamaha was the first company to invent a specialize electric bike with its Power Assist System (PAS).
The PAS is powered by a new efficient battery with better functionality and charger. We believe that public health is important to the heavy use of batteries 
and chargers. In addition, the safety of technicians and riders are important, so we would like to understand more of the hardware side too. For instance, 
some e-product users might want more horsepower or convenience on a pedal free e-bike. We would like to integrate our application with what our users want out of 
their own products.

Lori Pepper, Dep. Secr. for Innovative Mobility Solutions (State of California) -> Lori has backgrounds in technology and Artificial Intelligence compliance to the Federal
Government. We believe that she can contribute to the safety of everyone on the road. Our ethical standards can be beneficial by her work.

Item 4 - Experiementation & Priorities

Consider the following ideas from AI NOW report 2018: Expanding AI fairness beyond a focus on mathematics and statistical fairness toward issues of justice Accounting for 
the many forms of labor required to create and maintain AI systems Committing to deeper interdisciplinary in AI Analyzing race, gender and power in AI Developing new policy
interventions and strategic litigation Building coalitions between researchers, civil society, and organizers within the technology sector

Since part of the business plan is to alleviate a distance in radius, we will use API's such as maps applications. As much as possible, an algorithm developed by our team 
will continuously refine and update. Depending on the amount of users within an area, we would like to modify the costs. The costs in fees for service and revenue for 
technicians/ mechanics and us, should not exhaust heavily. Rather, we want to streamline further, so that connectivity occurs, the application remains active, and reliability 
lives within the application. As mentioned previously, our application is innovative partially based on e-product usage on food delivery service platforms.

Modifying costs will help generate growth of our business, in return, we would like to use it towards the extra mile in progresses in modern societal trends. For instance,
a group of friends who commute together on weekends, or colleagues who commute together publicly. The more users there are in a given radius, the more opportunities there are 
for everyone. We pride to prioritize safety and efficiency. Service will be given to EBC users, and contract mechanics/techs will be paid in heavily usage or surge areas.

When reliability meets the needs of everyone's purpose with EBC, it opens doors to more opportunities. For this reason, we would like to prioritize data privacy.
The balance between exciting opportunities and data privacy go hand in hand.
